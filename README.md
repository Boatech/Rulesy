So to use you must have NPM installed.Am assuming we all use Windows, if yes then check out  ðŸ§ª [how to install Node.js](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-node-js-npm-on-windows) You can check if it was downloaded successfully by entering `npm -v` in your terminal. If you are using Mac however, you can check it out [how to install Node.js (mac)](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-npm-mac) 

## ðŸ¦® setup

Once installed, you should have the latest version of xampp, a xampp with 8.0.9 PHP version type or above, you can also download the latest which is with PHP 8.1 Here's the [link](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) . So far, Rulsey from my side was built in PHP 8.0.9

There are other things you need to download , here is [tailwind] (https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) , also after that install [flowbite] (https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart/) , also install [vue] (https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html#NPM) and lastly install [vue-tailwind] (https://www.vue-tailwind.com/docs/installation)

That's all you need to install for now!

1. go to command prompt and change the path `cd C:\xampp\projects\htdocs\rulesy` hit enter 
2. After you are in the  project  enter `npm init`
3. Then you can start up localhost and open the project , please not that you can use for example `/index` instead of `/index.php`, i have configured it to remove extensions, that's in the *.htaccess* file
4. I actually used [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/) to read my screen during development
5. Please do not mess with the *.htaccess* file , it is the configuration of the project
