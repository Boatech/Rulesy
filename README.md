# hello guys

Now this project uses node.js, tailwindCSS, normalize.css, PHP, Hack and Olsen Mainstream
So to use you must have NPM installed.Am assuming we all use Windows, if yes then check out  ðŸ§ª [how to install Node.js](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-node-js-npm-on-windows) You can check if it was downloaded successfully by entering `npm -v` in your terminal.

## ðŸ¦® setup

Once installed, you should have xampp with 8.0.9 PHP version type, you can also download the latest which is with PHP 8.1 Here's the [link](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)

There are other things you need to download , here is [tailwind] (https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) , also after that install [flowbite] (https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart/) , also install [vue] (https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html#NPM) and lastly install [vue-tailwind] (https://www.vue-tailwind.com/docs/installation)

That's all you need to install for now!

1. go to command prompt and change the path `cd C:\xampp\projects\htdocs\phaxad` hit enter 
2. After you are in the  project  enter `npm init`
3. Then you can start up localhost and open the project , please not that you can use for example `/index` instead of `/index.php`, i have configured it to remove extensions, that's in the *.htaccess* file
4. I actually used [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/) to read my screen during development
